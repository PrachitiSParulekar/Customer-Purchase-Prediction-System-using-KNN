Customer Purchase Prediction System using KNN
Overview
This project implements a customer purchase prediction system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It utilizes a dataset of mall customers to predict whether a customer is a high spender based on demographic and spending data. The system also demonstrates customer segmentation using k-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups.

Dataset

The dataset used is the "Mall Customers" dataset, which contains demographic features such as Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score for a set of customers. The dataset is openly available and commonly used for practice in machine learning.

**Features:**

Age

Gender

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1-100)



Perform and visualize customer clustering.
